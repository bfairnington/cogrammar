# Practical Task 3

# Follow these steps:

# Create a new Python file in this folder called conversion.py

# As in the previous practical tasks, please first provide pseudo code as
# comments in your Python file, outlining how you will solve this problem.

# Declare the following variables:
#   num1 = 99.23
#   num2 = 23
#   num3 = 150
#   string1 = “100”

# Convert them as follows:
#   num1 into an integer
#   num2 into a float
#   num3 into a String
#   string1 into an integer

# Print out all the variables on separate lines

#############################################################################

# Print the data type for each variable
num1 = 99.23
num2 = 23
num3 = 150
string1 = "100"

print(type(num1))
print(type(num2))
print(type(num3))
print(type(string1))

# Convert each variable using pythons in-built functions to define each data type
num1 = int(num1)
num2 = float(num2)
num3 = str(num3)
string1 = int(string1)

# Print each variable
print(num1)
print(num2)
print(num3)
print(string1)

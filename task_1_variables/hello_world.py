# Practical Task 1

# Follow these steps:

# Create a new Python file in the Dropbox folder for this task, and call it
# hello_world.py.

# First, provide pseudo code as comments in your Python file, outlining
# how you will solve this problem (you’ll need to read the rest of this
# practical task first of course!).

# Now, inside your hello_world.py file, write Python code to take in a user’s
# name using input() and then print out the name.

# Use the same input and output approach to take in a user’s age and
# print it out.

# Finally, print the string “Hello World!” on a new line (the new line will
# happen by default if you use a separate print statement to the one you
# used immediately above to print out the age, because each print
# statement automatically inserts an “enter”, or newline instruction, at the
# end).

# Use input function to input name and then print
name = input("Input user's name:")
print(f'Name: ' + name)

# Use input function to input age and then print
age = input("Input user's age:")
print(f'Age: ' + age)

# Print "Hello World!"
print("Hello World!")
